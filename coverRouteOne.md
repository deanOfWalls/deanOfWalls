Hiring Manager  
RouteOne  
31500 Northwestern Hwy, Suite 300, Farmington Hills, MI 48334  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer - .NET position at RouteOne. With a solid background in full-stack development and a passion for creating high-performance web applications, I am eager to bring my skills and dedication to your Agile development team.

### Technical Skills and Experience
I have hands-on experience with .NET Standard, .NET Framework, and .NET Core, as well as client-side web development using HTML 5, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Angular. My personal projects, such as **InPlainSight**—an image steganography tool—and **Bachelor Strength**—a fitness calculator and workout routine app—demonstrate my ability to create functional and user-friendly applications. These projects have strengthened my skills in both front-end and back-end development, aligning well with the requirements of this role.

### Commitment to Learning and Development
I have dedicated over 1000 hours to developing my skills in Java, test-driven development, full-stack development, and AGILE methodologies through my training at Zip Code Wilmington. This intensive training has equipped me with a strong foundation in software development practices and a commitment to continuous improvement. I am also experienced in troubleshooting and resolving application defects within mature production systems.

### Alignment with RouteOne's Values
RouteOne’s focus on building high-quality, standards-based systems and your commitment to Agile methodologies resonate with my professional values. I am particularly impressed by your emphasis on collaborative design and code reviews, which I believe are crucial for developing robust and scalable applications. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to and grow within such a forward-thinking environment.

### Enthusiastic and Ready to Contribute
I am confident that my technical skills, combined with my dedication to continuous learning and collaboration, make me a strong candidate for this position. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to RouteOne.

Sincerely,

Christopher Dean Walls
