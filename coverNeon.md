Hiring Manager  
Neon One  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer I position at Neon One. As an entry-level developer passionate about full-stack development, I am eager to bring my skills and enthusiasm for technology to your innovative team.

### Technical Skills and Experience
I have hands-on experience with Java, Spring Boot, JavaScript, React, and SQL. My personal projects, such as **InPlainSight**—an image steganography tool—and **Bachelor Strength**—a fitness calculator and workout routine app—demonstrate my ability to create functional and user-friendly applications. These projects have strengthened my skills in both front-end and back-end development, aligning well with the requirements of this role.

### Commitment to Learning
I have dedicated over 1000 hours to developing my skills in Java, test-driven development, full-stack development, and AGILE methodologies through my training at Zip Code Wilmington. This intensive training has equipped me with a strong foundation in software development practices and a commitment to continuous improvement.

### Alignment with Neon's Values
Neon One's focus on career development, community involvement, and work-life balance is particularly appealing to me. I am impressed by your commitment to fostering a supportive and engaging workplace culture. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to and grow within such an environment.

### Enthusiastic and Ready to Contribute
I am confident that my technical skills and dedication to continuous learning make me a strong candidate for this position. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to Neon One.

Sincerely,

Christopher Dean Walls
