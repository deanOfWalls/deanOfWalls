### Hiring Manager
Terumo Medical Corporation  
Position: App Support Specialist I  
Location: Elkton, MD

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the App Support Specialist I position at Terumo Medical Corporation as advertised. With a solid foundation in software development, particularly with Java, C#, and SQL, I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to your team.

My recent project work, including a CRUD Demo developed using Java and Spring Boot, illustrates my proficiency with software development that could be beneficial in handling the configuration and support of Terumoâ€™s manufacturing and quality applications. Additionally, my involvement in a blockchain project where I performed environment setup and configurations demonstrates my ability to work within structured and compliance-focused frameworks.

My technical background is complemented by strong problem-solving skills and an ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders, which are crucial for the collaborative and interdisciplinary environment at Terumo.

I am drawn to this opportunity due to Terumo's commitment to improving healthcare outcomes through technological innovation. I am eager to bring my background in software development and project management to ensure that Terumo continues to deliver high-quality medical devices efficiently.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my technical skills and project experiences can contribute to the ongoing success and growth of Terumo Medical Corporation.

Sincerely,

Christopher Dean Walls
