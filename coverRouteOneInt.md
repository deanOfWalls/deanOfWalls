Hiring Team  
RouteOne  
Farmington Hills, MI, US

Dear Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineering Intern position at RouteOne. With my strong foundation in Java and full-stack development, as well as hands-on experience building and deploying enterprise-scale applications, I am confident that I can contribute effectively to your development team while continuing to learn and grow in a collaborative environment.

In my current role as a Software Engineer Intern at Air Liquide, I have worked on developing internal tools that streamline operational workflows. Through these projects, I have gained experience in Java, Spring Boot, and Docker, which has enhanced my ability to write clean, scalable code. Although my internship is concluding, I am eager to apply the knowledge and skills Iâ€™ve acquired in a new setting where I can continue to grow technically and professionally. I am particularly drawn to RouteOne's focus on pairing and collaboration, which aligns with my passion for learning through teamwork.

Your emphasis on object-oriented programming, relational databases, and software development processes such as Agile and Scrum resonates with my background and interests. I am confident that my experience with version control systems like Git, and my adaptability to new technologies, will allow me to contribute meaningfully to RouteOne's Application Development team.

Thank you for considering my application. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to further discuss how my skills and experiences align with the goals of your team. I look forward to contributing to RouteOne's continued success.

Sincerely,  
Christopher Dean Walls
