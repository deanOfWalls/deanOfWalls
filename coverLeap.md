Hiring Team  
Microsoft Leap Program  
Microsoft Corporation

Dear Hiring Team,

I’m excited to apply for the Software Engineer position in the upcoming Microsoft Leap cohort starting January 2025. With a passion for technology and a non-traditional career path that has strengthened my adaptability and problem-solving skills, I’m eager to contribute to Microsoft’s innovative projects and continue growing as a software engineer.

### My Unique Journey into Tech
Despite a deep interest in technology from an early age, local educational opportunities were limited. This led me to work in various roles, including help desk support and even truck driving, where I developed strong problem-solving abilities and a commitment to learning. When I discovered Zip Code Wilmington's coding boot camp, I seized the opportunity, saved up, quit my job, and dedicated myself fully to developing my skills in software development.

### Technical Skills and Real-World Application
Since graduating, I’ve been applying my skills in Java, Spring Boot, JavaScript, and React to real-world projects, including a software engineering internship where I’m developing tools that improve productivity and streamline workflows. This internship has allowed me to continue building my technical skills and gain valuable experience working on impactful projects.

### Why Microsoft Leap Excites Me
I’m particularly drawn to the Microsoft Leap program because it offers a unique blend of learning and hands-on experience, which aligns perfectly with my goals. I’m excited about the opportunity to work with industry experts at Microsoft, contribute to meaningful products, and continue advancing my career in software engineering.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to Microsoft’s mission and being part of a team that drives innovation and empowers others.

Sincerely,

Christopher Dean Walls
