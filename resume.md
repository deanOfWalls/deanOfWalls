### CRUD Demo
    * CRUD Demo is a CRUD application built on Java and Spring Boot, using ajax, html, and <br>css for the front-end, containerized using Docker, deployed to the free cloud <br>service, Render.com. The Dockerfile utilizes bash scripting in order to prevent the <br>web application from being put in sleep by the cloud service's inactivity timer by<br> sending HTTP requests to itself using curl.
